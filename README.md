# DeskClub - co-working space website clone, design found on dribble.

Live: https://jonkohjj.github.io/DeskClub/


Build this website from scratch as part of my portfolio, referencing a design found on dribble - 

https://dribbble.com/shots/15484299-DeskClub-Coworking-Space-Website

I used pure HTML, CSS and a little Javascript.

Concepts learnt:
1. Building a website with responsiveness in mind from the very start - designing mobile view and then desktop view using media queries
2. max-width / max-height
3. flexbox and grid

Anyfeed back is appreciated.
