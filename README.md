Built this website from scratch, referencing a design found on dribble -

Site was build using pure HTML, CSS and javascript with responsive layouts taken into consideration right from the start. I used mainly media queries, rem units and took a mobile first approach. No libraries was used e.g. bootstrap to acheive this as I wanted to practice coding with pure CSS.

Concepts learnt:
1. Building a website with responsiveness in mind from the very start
2. max-width / max-height
3. flexbox and grid
