# DeskClub Landing Page - co-working space website clone, design found on dribble.

The goal of this project is to reference a website design and built it from scratch while replicating it to my best ability. Site was build using pure HTML, CSS and javascript with responsive layouts taken into consideration right from the start. I used mainly media queries, rem units and took a mobile first approach. No libraries was used e.g. bootstrap to acheive this as I wanted to practice coding with pure CSS.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
